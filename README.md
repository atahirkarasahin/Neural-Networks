# Neural-Networks
This repository has been prepared on the topics covered in the artificial neural networks course in the fall semester of 2022-2023.

You can access the weekly presentations of the course at www.

Within the scope of the course: adaline, perceptron, multi-layer perceptron, learning vector quantization and adaptive resonance theory neural networks are explained.

A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is designed to solve the classification problem on the MNIST dataset.

Adaptive resonance theory (ART1) was designed to solve the classification problem on the IRIS dataset.
